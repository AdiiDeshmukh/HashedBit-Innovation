# 🚀 Hashedbit Innovation: Web Development Journey

Welcome to my portfolio of assignments and projects completed during my training at **Hashedbit Innovation**. This repository showcases my transition from building basic web structures to developing full-scale React applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized by milestone, representing a clear progression in my technical skills:

### 1. HTML & CSS Fundamentals
* **Static Pages:** Semantic HTML5 structures and CSS3 styling.
* **Responsive Design:** Using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure mobile compatibility.

### 2. JavaScript Core
* **Fundamentals:** Assignments covering variable scope and object handling (keys, assign).
* **Array Manipulation:** Practical implementation of `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.

### 3. React Development

  * Features a 4x4 movie grid.
  * Implements multi-page routing and state management for booking.

## 📽️ Featured Project: Movie Booking System

This is my capstone project for **Assignment 8**. It demonstrates a real-world flow for theater ticket booking.

### Key Functionalities
* **Dynamic Movie List:** Renders 20 movies with ratings and genres.
* **Booking Flow:** 1. Select a movie from the grid.
  2. View detailed descriptions and ratings.
  3. Fill out the booking form with validation.
  4. Receive a unique alphanumeric Booking ID on the confirmation ticket.
* **Storage:** Uses `sessionStorage` to handle data between routes without a backend.

## 🛠️ How to Run the React App

To run the Movie Booking System locally on your machine:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Assignment-8

   Install the dependencies:

Bash
npm install
Start the development server:

Bash
npm run dev
Open your browser: Visit http://localhost:5173.

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
React Hooks: useState for form data and useEffect for page redirects.

React Router: BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route for navigation.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for a professional dark-themed UI.
